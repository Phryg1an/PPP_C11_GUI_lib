1: Find lowest and highest x's
2: Find number of stripe lines we need ((highest x / lowest x) / 4)
3: Find number of lines we have in the polyshape
4: For each 

Find lowest and highest x's
Find highest and lowest y's

Make an array of two arrays, with a number of cells equal to the number of x points needed for the stripes.
Fill each cell with -100

For each line:
	-get the y co-ords for each x co-ord along the line
	-place the y co-ords in the first array of the array of arrays that has a -100 in it. must check for each point*.
	-if non of the arrays has a -100 in it at the specified point, create a new array in the array of arrays

For each x co-ord:
	get all the y points across each array
	sort the y points
	for n/2 times, draw the lines


Or...........

Make an array of as many arrays as we have lines (point num+1 / 2), with a number of cells equal to the number of x points needed for the stripes.
Last line needs to be first point and last point.
Fill each cell with -100

For each line:
	-get the y co-ords for each x co-ord along the line (trig)
	-place the y co-ords in a single array at the position x co-ord - xmin.

For each x co-ord:
	get all the y points across each array, by iterating over the arrays and retaining only those points that are not -100
	sort the y points
	for n/2 times, draw the lines
